    abstract: `Topical gels are commonly used for topical application or to specific mucous membrane to achieve local effects,
facilitate transdermal drug delivery, or provide emollient and protective properties.Incorporating drugs into gel
matrices enables effective drug delivery, enhancing local action in analgesia and dermatological conditions.
Nicotinamide has proven to be an effective anti- tan agent when topically applied.It reduces melanin transfer and
production, thus preventing skin darkening caused by UV radiation.Additionally, nicotinamide offers other skin
benefits such as improved barrier function and reduced inflammation, making it a promising component in
    skincare products.Kojic acid, a natural agent, inhibits tyrosinase activity and aids in reducing skin tanning.
To develop topical hydrogel formulations, Hydrophilic polymers like triethanolamine(TEA) and Carbomer at
different concentrations were employed.The formulations underwent evaluation tests encompassing visual
appearance, pH, viscosity, spreadability, assay, and in vitro drug release studies using a USP V dissolution
apparatus.Accelerated temperature(40 ± 20°C) and humidity conditions(75 ±5 % RH) were applied to assess
formulation stability.Notable changes in the physicochemical properties of the formulations were not observed
under these conditions.Based on in vitro evaluation studies, the gel formulation comprising 1 % w / v
Triethanolamine and 0.5 % w / v Carbomer demonstrated suitability for topical application.These findings indicate
the feasibility of formulating a topical gel containing kojic acid and nicotinamide hydrogel.`,

    abstract: `Everyone in today's culture and corporate environment is stressed out as a result of the increased competition.
According to the definition of stress, it is "the force, pressure, or force exerted on a material, object, or person that
resists these forces and attempts to sustain its unique state." Stress is the body's physical and emotional response to
changes, circumstances, and events in a person's life. The harmful physical and emotional responses that arise
when a worker's abilities, resources, or needs do not match the demands of the job are known as occupational
stress. In addition to increasing life's difficulties, work stress negatively impacts security guards' health. Due to
prolonged periods of time spent awake, security guards experience stress from an early level, which increases their
mental tension. hence this study is based on job stress among private security guards in Raipur city.`,

    abstract: `In August 2019, Government of India passed a legislation that requires large companies to spend at least 2 percent
of their profits every year on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The High Level Committee of Public
Accountability attached to Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in India as a result of their public ownership makes
socially responsible reporting by Public Sector Undertakings particularly important. In this respect, every Public
Sector Undertaking has a moral responsibility to play an active role in discharging the social obligations evolved
on a welfare state subject to the financial health of the enterprise. Corporate Social Responsibility is about tradition
and culture. Internal performance evaluation of employees could recognize community work. Community work
can take many forms teaching in government schools, supporting Non-Government Organizations financially,
empowering women, cleaning parks, planting trees, volunteering in orphanages, protecting the abused. The
emergence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been critical for millions of people left below the poverty
line. Innovative partnerships between governments, corporate, businesses and civil societies hold the potential to
touch the lives of millions, leading to enhanced quality of living through better access to essential services. The
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities undertaken by PSUs include old age homes, computer training,
access to library, AIDS prevention camps, leadership lectures, construction of sanitation block, solar energy based
street lights, health center for regular health care, free medical dispensary, cataract surgery, community center,
training on income generation vocations, go green policy and waste management. This study concentrates to study
the opinion of employees’ on impact factors of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices in select public
sector Oil Companies to the city of Nagpur. The public sector Oil Companies taken into consideration for the study
includes Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Corporation
Limited, Nagpur Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. Random sampling
procedure has been used in the study to select the sample respondents. Analysis of variance has been used to
analyze the impact factors on Corporate Social Responsibility and suitable hypothesis are framed for this purpose.

of consumer satisfaction with online purchases in order to analyze their level of satisfaction, problems during
online purchases, factors that affect online purchases, their level of awareness and some recommendations to
increase their level of satisfaction. Electronic commerce is essentially concerned with the exchange of information
via the Internet. Today's consumers are very busy and want to save time and money that is why they use online
shopping. This study will be very useful for the company to develop consumer satisfaction strategies and improve
the sales of products and consumers, since they will obtain a product with much greater added value beyond which

    abstract: `The Refrigerators and air conditioners based on vapour compression refrigeration cycle are one of the important
elements of the society either for domestic or industrial purposes. it is essential in view of energy crisis to reduce the
power consumed by these refrigerators. This paper presents a new dimension and or specification for monitoring the
power consumed based on location and computation of irreversibility. COP of a reversible cycle is highest amongst
all refrigerators operating between the same temperature limits, this characteristic of a reversible cycle is applied to
an actual vapour compression refrigeration system setup. The result is that we can locate the component of the system
which contributes most towards irreversibility and also, we can calculate the amount of irreversibility thereby
knowing the extra power consumed by the component. If the amount of irreversibility is taken as a specification for
either replacing or maintaining the system, we can save the extra power consumed. In view of energy crisis this
becomes very important. This paper uses the Ist and IInd law thermodynamic analysis to locate and calculate the
irreversibility in a vapour compression refrigeration system. The computations are made for an actual vapour
compression refrigeration cycle setup considering up to 7 decimal places. The result gives the extra power required
by compressor. The difference between actual power & Carnot power equals 1.1174206, which is equal to the
product of irreversibility rate & ambient temperature. This analysis when applied to an actual system acts like a
power saving mode, we have in a personal computer`,

    filePath: `./PDF/Journals/2024/volume-1-issue-1/paper7.pdf`,
    abstract: `The growing popularity and awareness of the health advantages of organic food, particularly among young people,
has increased demand significantly. The majority of population is confused about organic food and agricultural
goods and lack knowledge about them. Few are typically aware of the relationship between organic food and
human health, as well as the need of preserving future generations. The lack of acceptable appropriate quality
evaluations and regulations is the most significant barrier that India has in its quest to become one of the world's
major organic food producers. The scarcity of organic food goods is a serious issue for society's health-conscious
youngsters. They mostly purchase organically cultivated fruits, vegetables, cereals, and herbs from branded retail
outlets. Procuring healthier food, as well as an efficient marketing structure and the required backing from the
government, as well as improving supply chain management and production planning, were shown to be successful
in resolving concerns with organic food items. As a result, this research aims to provide a platform for assessing
reasons and barriers influencing customers to purchase organic food products in Raipur city.`,

    abstract: `Today a wide variety of investment vehicles exists including stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds, exchangetraded funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, gold, silver, retirement plans and real estate. Investment
preference is related to the activities of individual investors regarding searching, evaluating, selecting and
reviewing the investment products, if necessary, disposing such investment products and acquiring other
investment products. A study of investment preference reveals how the individual investors allocate their savings
to various available instruments. This process includes, why they invest, where they invest, how they get required
information, what factors they use and who influences them and how they act after investment decisions are taken.
The individual investors differ in terms of age, family circumstances, level of income, residence, insurance
coverage, tax incidence etc. In this study, an attempt has been made to study the demographic profile of women
teachers working in Government Higher Secondary Schools in Chhattisgarh and to identify the preference of
women teachers in various investments alternatives such as gold, silver, bank deposits, post office savings scheme,
LIC insurance schemes, chit funds, real estate, shares, mutual funds, government securities and precious objects. In
addition, their sources of information for investments, decision maker in investments, annual investment and time
horizon of investment are also taken in to consideration. The study results are purely based on the opinions of 200
teachers selected by employing random sampling method. The statistical tools such as frequency tables, Friedman
test and chi-square test has been used. The information collected from the teachers’ formed the basis for analysis
and interpretation of data, to derive the findings and to arrive at conclusion`,
