    abstract: `The main purpose of this study is to prepare a cosmetic containing gel. Using herbal ingredients to combat acne, wrinkles and control oil production is called natural or herbal cosmetics. The skin on the face is frequently in contact with dirt, pollution, and other pollutants. Safe and effective natural substances with anti-depilation, antibacterial, anti-infective, antioxidant, and anti-aging properties are found in the scrub. The main objective of this study was to develop a herbal face scrub with natural components that would prevent and treat a variety of skin issues in addition to managing oil production on the skin's surface. In order to address all of these problems and remove tan lines from the face, use a scrub composed only of natural ingredients that enhances cleansing, softening, moisturising, and skin tone while also getting rid of extra facial hair. The products that enhance skin function are herbal ones. Formulating and assessing a herbal face scrub with natural components that includes orange peel and tamarind peel powder for skin exfoliation and beautiful skin is the aim of this endeavour.`,

      'Polymeric Drug Conjugation Micelle for The Treatment of Anti - Inflammatory Diseases',

    abstract: `The report discusses the potential of polymeric drug conjugation micelles in the targeted treatment of inflammatory diseases across various conditions. It explores the biological processes of inflammation and how these micelles could be utilized to deliver drugs effectively to inflamed tissues or cells, minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. The focus is on utilizing nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems to precisely target inflammatory sites while sparing healthy tissues, thus improving the management of inflammatory diseases. Polymeric drug conjugation micelles (PDCMs) offer a promising approach to treat anti-inflammatory diseases. Comprising a hydrophilic core and a hydrophobic drug-loaded shell, PDCMs shield drugs from degradation until they reach target sites. Recent studies using PDCMs to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone to rats with rheumatoid arthritis and ibuprofen to mice with asthma showed reduced inflammation and improved organ function. These results suggest PDCMs could effectively treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and asthma, but further research is needed to optimize their design and evaluate their safety and efficacy in humans.`,

    abstract: `To formulate and evaluate the nutraceutical tablets with different combination of herbal drugs. Material and Method: The nutraceutical tablet containing lactose and mannitol as diluent and containing natural drugs like clove and cinnamon which was prepared by direct compression method. Pre-compression studies of nutraceutical tablet shows satisfactory results. The thickness, hardness, weight variation, and friability of nutraceutical tablet were found to inacceptable range. The in-vitro drug release of eugenol from optimised nutraceutical formulation was found to be 90.23%. Significant results were obtained from present study. Discussion: The finding of current investigation clearly found that the health promotion of the body could be done by nutraceuticals.`,

    abstract: `Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute serious health consequences and underreporting of ADRs by health care professionals (HCPs) is found to be a major problem due to the lack of awareness. The present study was carried out to evaluate the KAP about ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance among HCPs in a rural area in Palakkad District. A questionnaire-based observational survey was conducted among HCPs of a Community Health Centre and a private hospital in Palakkad District. The responses were analyzed and the results were entered in MS-Excel 2010, Statistical analysis was done using Graph pad Prism and chi-square test was done to find the level of significance. Out of 250 questionnaires circulated, 218 health care professionals positively completed and returned of which 23 were from community health centre and 195 from a private hospital. Out of the total participants 104 (48%) were males and 114 (52%) were females. On analyzing the knowledge among health professionals, we found physicians and pharmacist have better knowledge than other HCPs and was found to have statistical relationship (p<0.05). We found a positive response toward attitude and practice and the major problem of under reporting was lack of time and knowledge. Lack of knowledge is found to be a major issue of underreporting and must be rectified by proper awareness campaigns, continuing education programs etc.`,

    abstract: `Monsoon in India is a key constraint for agricultural development. Although the agriculture engineering in India has been developed in a spectacular way, still more over 75% of crop cultivation is dependent on monsoon. Monsoon data time series shows highly chaotic behavior and thus its accurate prediction is a challenging subject of research round the globe. However approximately 50 meteorological parameters i.e. predictors have been identified. Those parameters work region wise, and researchers have to recognize suitably fit parameters for their pointed region. Though there are various meteorological parameters that affect the amount of rainfall, but other than those parameters the climatic phenomenon such as El Nino and La Nina always affect the intensity of monsoon. The South West Monsoon is a critical climatic phenomenon for India, pointedly influencing the region's agriculture, water resources, and overall economy. El Nino and La Nina events, which are part of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), play a dynamic role in tempering the monsoon's behavior. This research article aims to analyze the effects of El Nino and La Nina on South West Monsoon rainfall patterns.`,

    abstract: `Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections affecting the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Primarily caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, UTIs present with symptoms such as painful urination, frequent urges to urinate, and cloudy or bloody urine. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual activity, and urinary tract abnormalities. Diagnosis involves urine analysis and culture, with treatment primarily consisting of antibiotics. Prevention strategies include hydration, urinating after sex, and maintaining good hygiene. Recurrent UTIs may require further investigation and tailored management to mitigate future occurrences. Understanding UTIs is crucial for effective management and prevention, particularly in vulnerable populations.`,
