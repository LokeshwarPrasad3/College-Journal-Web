      'A Review on Harnessing Large Language Models to Transform Conversational Information Retrieval',
    author: '1. Amit Raj, 2. Kusum Sharma, 3. Parineeta Jha',
    filePath: `./PDF/Journals/2025/volume-2-issue-1/paper1.pdf`,
    abstract: `The exponential growth of unstructured data has made conventional search systems insufficient for addressing
modern needs. Cognitive search refers to an advanced form of search technology that uses AI and ML to
understand, interpret, and deliver search results that are highly relevant to the user’s intent and context.
Information retrieval is a core component of computing that has progressed from simple keyword searches to
advanced and intelligent search systems. Traditional search algorithms depend heavily on exact keyword
matches, which can lead to a lack of understanding of user intent and context. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have showcased impressive abilities in text generation and understanding conversations. Precisely
determining users' contextual search intent has been a significant challenge in conversational search. Since
conversational search sessions tend to be more varied and unpredictable, current methods that are trained on
limited datasets often demonstrate inadequate effectiveness and resilience in addressing real-world
conversational search situations. Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) is a branch of Information
Retrieval (IR) that emphasizes obtaining relevant information through conversational exchanges. It has
progressed over the years due to advancements in natural language processing and machine learning. Traditional
CIR System relied on rule-based approaches and rigid query structures.`,

    filePath: `./PDF/Journals/2025/volume-2-issue-1/paper6.pdf`,
    abstract: `Rhinitis is characterised by nasal symptoms such as anterior or posterior rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal obstruction,
and/or nose itching. Rhinitis is defined as an inflammation of the nose lining. Many days, these symptoms last for
over an hour and happen for two or more days in a row. The clinical desensitisation produced by the specially
formulated sublingual tablets containing peanut allergens provides a novel therapeutic alternative for the sensitive
population. As of right now, there are no FDA-approved sublingual medications for food allergies, particularly peanut
allergies. The clinical desensitisation produced by the specially formulated sublingual tablets containing peanut
allergens provides a novel therapeutic alternative for the sensitive population. A meta-analysis demonstrated that for
allergic illnesses, SLIT tablets were more effective than anti-allergic pharmacotherapies. The usage of SLIT pills was
linked to remarkably low levels of daily inhaled corticosteroid use, asthma aggravation risk, and asthmatic symptoms.

    abstract: `Financial Inclusion is the universal access to the financial service by every person of the society at an affordable price.
Covid 19 pandemic imposed social distancing and lockdown all over the world, then digital payment become the lifeline of
many people. Indian government initiated various measures to encourage financial inclusion in country since 2000 but this
process took speed in 2015 when Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was launched, its main objective was to provide
financial services to wide areas at an affordable price and its first step was to provide adults with a bank account which
plays the key role in boosting financial inclusion in India. After demonetization many schemes and new technologies came
into existence to make financial service safe and easy, some of them are Unified Payment Interface (UPI), Aadhar Enabled
Payment System (AEPS), mobile wallet or E-Wallets like Google pay, Jio pay, BHIM app etc. Increase in the use of mobile
phone, availability of speedy internet boosts the use of these technologies. Though there is the lack of financial literacy
among most of the Indians but Indian government is taking many initiatives like Vittiya Saksharta Abhiyan (VISAKA),
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan yojana, Mudra bank yojana etc. to enhance financial literacy. The aim of this paper is to discuss
what are the innovative e-services available for financial inclusion, how these technologies and mobile apps are helping
India to reach the unserved population and leading to economic development in India.`,
